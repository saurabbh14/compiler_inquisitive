# Few words ...
Designing a programming language is a fascinating process.
In the age of OOP dominated programming world, existence of 
high-level APIs bypasses the need to interact with low-level
intricacies. However, how these programming languages are
programmed, is to me a mystery. Basically I lacked the understanding
of compiler/interpreter design. So, I started to dig into the
topic and what I found that although building a production-level
compiler is very complicated (not an easy task at all! Much respect!),
writing a simple and crude compiler for a limited syntax is
quite easy* (*once you understand the workings of Abstract Syntax Tree AST.
And I do not claim full understanding).

This repo is an attempt to gather together some tutorial works
and their attempted expansions in my pursuit to learn compiler
design. I don't claim this to be an original work rather more
of a follow along exercise and some curious excursions.
